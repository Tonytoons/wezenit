Hi there! Welcome to zenovly.com code!

To get you started, in side folder "public" - all in index.php.

1) Open the index.php file

2) Follow the run instructions with ZF3

3) If you want to look at the Apache logs, check out ~/lib/apache2/log

And that's all there is to it! Just have fun. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
The RockStar team
